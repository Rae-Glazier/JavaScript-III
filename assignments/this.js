* 2. Implicit Binding - this is the most common used rule. it knows what to bind the information to by looking to the left of the dot. 
* 3. Explicit Binding - call, apply & bind are used to explicityly state what the this keyword is 
* 4. New Binding - constructs a new object and using the new binding points to it
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
